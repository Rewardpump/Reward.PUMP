Reward.pump Project Plan
1. Project Overview
1.1 Project Background
PUMP.FUN, as an innovative platform within the Solana ecosystem, provides a low-cost, high-efficiency environment for token creation and trading. Through its "Creator Revenue Sharing" program, PUMP.FUN allows token creators to earn income from transaction fees. This mechanism provides a sustainable revenue source for token projects, incentivizing more creators to participate in the ecosystem. However, most current revenue-sharing plans are still limited to the creators themselves, lacking further incentives and return mechanisms for token holders.
1.2 Project Objectives
The "Reward.pump" project aims to leverage PUMP.FUN's Creator Revenue Sharing mechanism to create a new dividend incentive model, automatically distributing a portion of the transaction rewards to the top 500 token-holding addresses every ten minutes. The rewards from the creator's wallet are extracted and proportionally allocated to eligible token-holding addresses. This mechanism not only enhances the loyalty of token holders but also promotes the healthy development of the project ecosystem.
1.3 Project Name
Project Name: Reward.pump
Token Name: Reward
2. Project Mechanism Design
2.1 Dividend Incentive Fund Source
The dividend incentive funds are sourced from the transaction rewards earned by the developer wallet (creator's wallet) on the PUMP.FUN platform. PUMP.FUN's "Creator Revenue Sharing" program stipulates that creators can earn 0.05% of each transaction in SOL. These rewards will serve as the source of dividend funds.
2.2 Dividend Rules
2.2.1 Extraction Frequency
Rewards are automatically extracted from the creator's wallet every ten minutes. This frequency ensures the timeliness of dividends while reducing the potential risks associated with excessive fund accumulation.
2.2.2 Token-Holding Threshold
The top 500 token-holding addresses are eligible to participate in dividend distribution. This threshold is set to reward the top 500 holders, encouraging long-term holding behavior and enhancing the stability of the project ecosystem.
2.2.3 Allocation Ratio
Dividend funds will be distributed proportionally according to the number of Reward tokens held by each address. Assuming the total token supply is ( T ), and a particular address ( A ) holds ( a ) tokens, the dividend proportion for that address is:
\frac{a}{T}

This ratio ensures the fairness of dividend distribution, with larger holdings resulting in greater dividends.
2.2.4 Minimum Dividend Amount
To avoid transaction fee issues caused by excessively small dividend amounts, a minimum dividend amount threshold is set. For example, assuming the minimum dividend amount is 0.01 SOL, if the calculated dividend for a particular address falls below this threshold, no distribution will occur, and the funds will roll over to the next dividend cycle.
2.3 Automated Execution
The dividend process is fully automated, implemented through smart contracts or on-chain scripts. Every ten minutes, the system will:
Query the SOL balance changes in the creator's wallet to calculate the newly added transaction rewards.
Identify the top 500 token-holding addresses.
Calculate the dividend amount each eligible address should receive.
Execute the transfer operation to distribute the dividend funds to the corresponding addresses.
3. Project Advantages
3.1 Innovation
The "Reward.pump" project innovatively extends PUMP.FUN's Creator Revenue Sharing mechanism to token holders, creating a new dividend model. This model not only incentivizes creators but also mobilizes token holders, forming a dual-ecosystem incentive mechanism.
3.2 Fairness
Through proportional allocation and the top 500 token-holding addresses setting, "Reward.pump" ensures the fairness of dividend distribution. Larger holdings result in greater dividends, which helps stabilize the project ecosystem.
3.3 Sustainability
Dividend funds are sourced from PUMP.FUN's transaction rewards, ensuring sustainability. As long as the project maintains active trading on PUMP.FUN, the creator's wallet can continuously receive income, providing a stable source of funds for dividends.

8. Detailed Mechanism Supplement
8.1 Dividend Calculation Example
Assume that within a ten-minute period, the creator's wallet receives 10 SOL in transaction rewards, the total token supply is 100 million, and the top 500 token-holding addresses hold the following amounts:
Address 1: 10 million tokens
Address 2: 8 million tokens
Address 3: 6 million tokens
...
Address 500: 10,000 tokens
According to the top 500 token-holding addresses rule, all these addresses are eligible for dividend distribution. The total token supply for the top 500 is 50 million (assuming). The dividend proportion and amount for each address are calculated as follows:
Address 1: 
\frac{10 \text{ million}}{50 \text{ million}} \times 10 \text{ SOL} = 2 \text{ SOL}
Address 2: 
\frac{8 \text{ million}}{50 \text{ million}} \times 10 \text{ SOL} = 1.6 \text{ SOL}
Address 3: 
\frac{6 \text{ million}}{50 \text{ million}} \times 10 \text{ SOL} = 1.2 \text{ SOL}
...
Address 500: 
\frac{10,000}{50 \text{ million}} \times 10 \text{ SOL} = 0.002 \text{ SOL}
If the minimum dividend amount is 0.01 SOL, Address 500's dividend amount falls below the threshold and is not distributed, with the funds rolling over to the next dividend cycle.
8.2 Fund Flow Monitoring
To ensure the transparency and reliability of the dividend mechanism, the project needs to establish a fund flow monitoring system. The system should record the following information:
The transaction reward amount every ten minutes.
The list of eligible addresses and their token holdings.
The actual SOL amount distributed and each address's receipt.
Funds that do not meet the minimum dividend amount and are rolled over.
This system not only enhances user trust in the project but also provides data support for future optimizations.
9. In-Depth Market Analysis
9.1 User Behavior Research
By analyzing user behavior within the PUMP.FUN ecosystem, a better understanding of "Reward.pump"'s target users can be achieved. Assume the data indicates:
80% of users sell their tokens shortly after creation, holding for less than a week.
15% of users hold for 1-3 months, with high trading frequency.
5% of users hold long-term, often holding more than one million tokens.
The top 500 token-holding addresses setting of "Reward.pump" targets these 5% long-term holders, aiming to further consolidate their loyalty through the dividend mechanism.
9.2 Competitive Project Comparison
Assume a competing project "DividendCoin" exists, with a monthly dividend mechanism and funding from project reserves. Compared to "Reward.pump," the advantages include:
Higher Frequency: Dividends every ten minutes, with stronger timeliness.
More Sustainable Funding Source: Directly sourced from PUMP.FUN's transaction rewards, rather than reserves.
Clearer Threshold: The top 500 token-holding addresses setting rewards long-term holders.
9.3 Market Trends
